# React AI Chat

React AI Chat is a minimal demo of streaming from an LLM to a frontend.

## Getting Started

To start the server that hosts the health check and chat endpoints, use the following:

```
npm run server
```

Then, start the vite dev server with:

```
npm run dev
```

You should be able to see the health status of the server, and make requests to the LLM. Responses are streamed.
